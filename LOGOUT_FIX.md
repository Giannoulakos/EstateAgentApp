# Logout Fix - macOS MachPort Error Resolution

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing macOS-specific errors during logout:

```
[91324:0706/140419.350574:ERROR:base/apple/mach_port_rendezvous_mac.cc:255] bootstrap_look_up com.github.Electron.MachPortRendezvousServer.1: Permission denied (1100)
[91324:0706/140419.351097:ERROR:base/memory/shared_memory_switch.cc:266] No rendezvous client, terminating process (parent died?)
```

## Root Cause

The errors were caused by abrupt process termination during logout. The previous implementation:

1. Immediately closed the main window
2. Created logout window without proper cleanup timing
3. Used `window.close()` instead of `window.destroy()`
4. Lacked proper timeout handling for logout operations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Logout Window Management

**File: `/src/main/auth-process.ts`**

- Added timeout mechanism (5 seconds) to prevent hanging
- Improved window options with proper sizing and restrictions
- Added navigation event handling for logout completion detection
- Graceful window destruction with error handling
- Proper cleanup sequence with delays

### 2. Enhanced Main Process Logout Flow

**File: `/src/main.ts`**

- Reordered logout sequence: logout first, then close main window
- Added delays between operations to ensure proper cleanup
- Improved error handling in app quit events
- Added `before-quit` and `will-quit` event handlers

### 3. Better Window Destruction

**File: `/src/main/auth-process.ts`**

- Changed from `window.close()` to `window.destroy()`
- Added `isDestroyed()` checks before operations
- Proper error handling in window destruction

### 4. App Lifecycle Improvements

**File: `/src/main.ts`**

- Added cleanup in `window-all-closed` event
- Added `before-quit` and `will-quit` handlers
- Proper auth window cleanup on app exit

## Key Features

### Timeout Mechanism

```typescript
const logoutTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Logout timeout reached, forcing cleanup...');
  // Force cleanup after 5 seconds
}, 5000);
```

### Graceful Window Destruction

```typescript
export const destroyAuthWindow = (): void => {
  if (!authWindow) return;

  try {
    if (!authWindow.isDestroyed()) {
      authWindow.destroy();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error destroying auth window:', error);
  } finally {
    authWindow = null;
  }
};
```

### Proper Logout Sequence

```typescript
// 1. Create logout window
createLogoutWindow(() => {
  // 2. Close main window after logout completes
  if (mainWindow) {
    mainWindow.close();
    mainWindow = null;
  }

  // 3. Show login window after delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    createAuthWindow(() => {
      createWindow();
    });
  }, 500);
});
```

## Results

- ✅ **No more MachPort errors**
- ✅ **Smooth logout transitions**
- ✅ **Proper window cleanup**
- ✅ **No abrupt process termination**
- ✅ **Graceful app exit handling**
- ✅ **Maintained authentication functionality**

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified to:

1. Eliminate macOS MachPort errors during logout
2. Maintain proper authentication flow
3. Handle edge cases (timeout, manual window closure)
4. Provide smooth user experience during logout/login cycles

## Compatibility

- **macOS**: Primary target, eliminates MachPort errors
- **Windows/Linux**: Improved stability and cleanup
- **Electron**: Compatible with all Electron versions
- **Auth0**: No impact on Auth0 integration
